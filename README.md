# Methodology
## Data Source
1. **OUSD neighborhood map**: The [OUSD neighborhood map](https://github.com/maxogden/oakland-boundaries-geojson/blob/master/neighborhoods.geojson) is downloaded from Max Ogden's public repository [oakland-boundaries-geojson on Github](https://github.com/maxogden/oakland-boundaries-geojson).
2. **Oakland public school list**: We got the school list from the [OUSD website](https://www.ousd.org/). Specifically, we cross-referenced the [school directory](https://www.ousd.org/page/323) and the [PDF version of the OUSD Schools Directory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8A8X8ktDxQkZFQ2bnZlMVQ5ZEE/view?resourcekey=0-jQJIVHh-bhglnAj8kmTbhQ) provided on the OUSD website. Eventually, we have 79 schools in total.  
3. **Oakland school geo locations**: Based on the abovementioned schools, we manually looked up the school cordinates on google map.
4. **Chart data**: The data for enrollment of the 11 schools, racial demographcis, percentage of socialeconomically disadvantaged students, and percentage of disabled students are from [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/). 
## Data Visualization
